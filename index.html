        <p>A little about me...</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>I'm Mavis and stuff, 22 years old, runaway American, majoring 
          in media design. I was interested in doing this course
          because I really like doing coded art and am very interested
          in the tec art scean. I thought that learning more about wed
          design would give me a new medium to explore those interests 
          in and I definetly feel that it did! I'm way more confident
          coding in html and css as well as more confident teaching 
          myself how to do this stuff. If you click on the side bar
          you can take a look at an interactive composition I made to
          get the gist of the other stuff I do.

        <p class = "txtlg">Flex Box Assignment</p>
        <p>15/3/20-22/3/20 (I had to re-do it later)</p>
        <p>Overall the flex box assignment worked out ok in the sense that I did 
            improve my understanding of how it all worked but I had some tecnical 
            problems that are not yet fully rectified... I was able to complete 
            the tutorial and get my website to look like the wireframes but when 
            it came to pushing my work to github I ran into some problems. I 
            thought I had followed the instructions correctly to create my own 
            branch but when I went to try and push my work I saw I was in the 
            master branch not the branch I had thought I had created. I couldn't 
            find my branch so I went to make a new one. I ended up with another 
            copy of the code that was in the master branch in a new seperate 
            branch but then I couldn't push anything to github because I kept 
            getting the message that I didn't have permission. I also realized 
            when I got home that in the process of creating a new branch I had 
            acidentally deleted my work and now only had the code that was in 
            the master branch and I still couldn't push anything to github. So 
            the long and the short of it is I did sucsessfully use flex boxes 
            and get the page to configure differently at different sizes but 
            I've lost my work and will now have to re do it. yay!</p>
            <p>So I've re-done the flex box assignment and everything went well. 
                It was much easier seeing as I've already done it once before. 
                It definetly felt like good review for using the width controlls.</p>

            <p>GitHub As A Collabarative Tool</p>
          
        </div>
        <p>8/3/20</p>
            <p>There are a few basic aspects of Github that make it a very 
                valuable tool for coding projects, particularly collaborative ones. 
                In short you have a log of old versions of youâ€™re code so you can 
                go back to past work if you make a mistake and you can create a 
                fork or branch of existing code so that multiple people can work 
                on the same project at once without messing with anyone elses work.
                You can also see other peoples branches so as to keep up with what
                other members of your group are doing.

                <p>On Off Switches Javascript Intro</p>
            </div>
            <p>29/3/20</p>
            <p>I have the code up and running to change between images with on and off 
                switches but I'm confused on how to link to an external javascript file 
                using the buttons. I'm also a bit confused on weather or not I should be 
                loading my images in the javascript file or html. The pictures I'm using 
                for on and off are below.</p>
              
                <img src="drawing-000272.jpg"  alt="on" width="100" height="100">
                <img src="drawing-000485.jpg"  alt="off" width="100" height="100">
            
                <p>I had a crack at this again today and only managed to confuse myself 
                    more! I thought what I was trying to do with the seperate js file 
                    wasn't working because I was doing something wrong in Javascript 
                    but now I can't get my css document to work either and I have no 
                    idea what's wrong! This is so weird...</p>

        <p>I found makeing the basic grid wireframes was pretty doable over all 
            I thought the tutorial was pretty fun. I just messed around looking at 
            the avalible examples and trying different things until I figured it out. 
            I think this tequnice will definetly come in handy.</p>

        <p>I was having a really hard time figuring out linking up a seperate
            javascript file before this tutorial as you can probably tell from 
            my entry about the on off switch assignment but this tutorial helped
            me out a lot. I went over the video explaining the tutorial while
            looking at the code and it all made a lot more sense.

            <p>8/3/20-NOW</p>
            <div class = "ent5txt1">
                <p>I started off with a very different concept for this blog as you will see from
                    my original wireframes. When I first came up with these wireframes I wasn't 
                    really sure how I was going to go about it as I was much less comfortable 
                    in html and css and I think that's the issue with wireframes and with my 
                    original set up for the blog. I also had pretty much no experience wireframing 
                    or prototyping a website. I had built a version of the blog where all 
                    of my entries were on seperate pages and I hated it so much.
                </p>
               
            </div>
            <div class = "ent5pics">
                <img src="Home.jpg" alt="wire1" width="200" height="240">
            <img src="reflect.jpg" alt="wire2" width="200" height="240">
            </div>
            <p>I know that the set up I have for the blog right now is pretty goofy and 
                probably not the most intuitive thing but the whole reason I took this course
                was to see what fun different things I can do in this medium and I've really
                had fun putting together this blog. I also think that so much stuff on the 
                internet is formatted in such similar ways it's kind of boring. I don't see 
                a reason why everything has to follow these same basic patterns so I wanted
                to make something different that might be more fun and interesting to look at.
                My eventual goal is to be able to code things that people really feel like they can 
                explore and hopefully what I've lerned in this class will further that goal.
                I know I could have put everything on seperate pages etc. Like I did with my 
                original version but when I strted doing this I was just having way to much 
                fun and I've decided to say screw it because I really like this.
